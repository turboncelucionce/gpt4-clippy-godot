## Overview

This is a little godot project that makes Microsoft Clippy appear on your desktop. His responses are fully generated by GPT-3.5 or 4.  Current features:

- You can type, or directly talk to Clippy using your microphone. The audio is automatically transcribed using OpenAI's Whisper API.
- Clippy can talk realistically using any voice you want by providing an ElevenLabs API key and your character voices.
- Clippy reacts to the user's input, like the user hovering their mouse over him, sending blank messages, being ignored for long periods of time, or clicking on him repeatedly. (In the code, these are referred to as "nonverbal" actions.)
- Clippy can memorize things between conversations.
- Clippy can be dragged across the screen and set to be Always On Top. 


## Requirements

For Clippy to function, you need to have an [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). To enable GPT-4 instead of GPT-3.5, you need to have been accepted into the [GPT-4 waitlist](https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api). **Be careful, GPT-4 usage costs a lot more than GPT-3.5** and shows little noticeable improvement in this use case. I recommend sticking to GPT-3.5 most of the time.

The projet was made on **Godot V3.5.1.stable.official**. It may work on other versions.

Optionally, you can make an account on [ElevenLabs](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/) and get an API key if you want Clippy to be able to speak, then get the appropriate [Voice Key](https://api.elevenlabs.io/docs#/voices/Get_voices_v1_voices_get) of the voice you want to assign.

### How to setup:

- You can download Clippy in the [Releases tab](https://github.com/turboncelucionce/gpt4-clippy-godot/releases/tag/release).
- When launching Clippy for the first time, he asks for your API keys. Just follow the instructions.
- An OpenAI key is required, but the ElevenLabs keys (the ones that make Clippy talk) are optional. There's a guide below on how to set it up.
- If you made a mistake, you can delete the keys any time by right-clicking on Clippy, then selecting "Delete memory and exit".
- After inputting the API keys and assuming they are correct, Clippy will remember them and everything should work!

## (Optional) Give Clippy a voice by using an ElevenLabs key

[ElevenLabs](https://beta.elevenlabs.io) is a website that lets people make super realistic AI voices. By making an account (and paying for a certain subscription tier), you can make Clippy talk.

- Make an account and make sure you have enough credits. Keep in mind, if you input your API key into the Clippy app, he will use up credits whenever he talks!
- Create a custom voice on the website (let's say you name it "Michael")
- Copy your API key from your profile, save it somewhere safe
- Go to the [API documentation](https://api.elevenlabs.io/docs#/voices/Get_voices_v1_voices_get)
- In "GET /v1/voices", click on the "Try it out!" button
- Paste your API key in the *xi-api-key* slot
- Click on *Execute*
- A long bit of code appears in "Response body". You can search for the name of the custom voice you made (in this case, "Michael") using CTRL+F
- After finding it, there should be a bit that says *"voice_id":* right above it, followed by a long code. That code is your Voice Key! Save it somewhere safe.
- When starting Clippy for the first time, he should ask for these codes. Simply give them to him! If he does not, right click on him > "delete memory and exit".


### TODO

I basically learned how to code with this project. Therefore, the code is extremely messy. It's also missing a lot of stuff.

- Add any kind of error handling whatsoever when sending HTTP requests. Clippy sometimes randomly crashes or hangs
- Add a system that tracks the length of the conversation and only sends the most recent messages when hitting Send, to avoid using up too many OpenAI tokens
- Add a way to switch from GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 and vice-versa directly in runtime
- Add sounds
- Add more "nonverbal" actions that Clippy detects and reacts to (like being dragged around a lot, or checking processes being launched on the computer, reacting if the user is playing games, make Clippy react if he's placed close to the recycle bin, etc)
- Import all of the anims from the sprite sheet
- Setup an idle animation system
- Add a way to control Clippy's volume
- Add a way to switch microphones.

Clippy is powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 or GPT-4. He may produce inappropriate or dangerous content and cannot reliably fact-check. I'm not responsible for the way you use it. Please don't be dumb.
